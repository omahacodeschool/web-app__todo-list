## Todo List

This is a starter application for building a database-driven todo list.

You'll be building the following features:

Users should be able to...

- ... sign up
- ... log in
- ... log out
- ... view all todo items (not just theirs)
- ... create new todo items and assign them to anyone
- ... edit any todo item, including assigning it to someone else
- ... delete a todo item

Consider this Todo List Application is being used within a family. The users might be parents, children, and a very intelligent cat. They all create todo items and assign themselves or someone else. When someone finishes a todo item, they mark it as completed.

### Getting Started

#### Installation

First, fork this repository, if you haven't already.

Then clone your fork on to your local development machine:

```zsh
cd ~/Code
git clone url_for_your_copy_of_this_assignment
```

(Note: You'll need to replace `url_for_your_copy_of_this_assignment` with the actual SSH URL for your repository, which looks something like `git@github.com:sumeetjain/web-toy__some-assignment.git`.)

That will create a folder named for the assignment in **~/Code**, and it will download the files from the repository into that folder.

Next, `cd` into that newly created folder, and run the setup script:

```zsh
cd the-newly-created-folder
bin/setup
```

(Note: You'll need to replace `the-newly-created-folder` with the actual name of the folder for your assignment.)

You won't need to run the setup script for this assignment again.

If the setup script does not return any failures or errors, you're ready to work on the assignment. Open the project folder in your code editor, and begin.
